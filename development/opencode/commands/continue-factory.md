description: Resume active Edoworks Factory work
agent: explore
---

## Current State

- `edoworks/factory` is the sole canonical factory.
- Issue #69 and PR #71 completed the repository-owned OpenCode development
  environment and `CANONICAL_FOR_NEW_WORK` state.
- Issue #70 tracks product and release-workflow decoupling.
- `OPERATIONALLY_CUT_OVER` and all later states remain unverified.
- Route readiness is blocked if tracked benchmark/catalog evidence is stale.

## Restart

1. Run `bin/factory-dev doctor` and read its JSON receipt.
2. Resolve integrity, predecessor-path, active-comparison, or routing blockers
   without changing provider budgets or fallback semantics without authority.
3. Continue the smallest independently verifiable issue #70 increment without
   modifying unrelated product branches.

## Boundaries

- Product runtime must not import or require development tooling.
- Do not delete predecessors, publish, release, or mutate external state without
  explicit applicable authority.
- Preserve unrelated worktree changes and all unverified state claims.
